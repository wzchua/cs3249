		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Nikon has redesigned the art of photography.</p>
		<p>Its products include cameras, camera lenses, binoculars, microscopes, ophthalmic lenses, measurement instruments, rifle scopes, spotting scopes, and the steppers used in the phtolithography steps of semiconductor fabrication, of which it is the world's second largest manufacturer.</p>
		<p>The companies held by Nikon from the Nikon Group. Among its products are Nikkor imaging lenses (for F-mount cameras, large format photography, photographic enlargers, and other applications), the Nikon F-series of 35mm film SLR cameras, the Nikon D-series od digital SLR cameras, the Coolpix series of compact digital cameras, and the Nikonos series of underwater film cameras. Nikon's main competitors in camera and lens manufacturing include Canon, Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and Olympus.</p>
		<p>Nikon Corporation was established on 25 July 1917 when three leading optical manufacturers merged to form a comprehensive, fully integrated optical company known as Nippon Kōgaku Tōkyō K.K. Over the next sixty years, this growing company became a manufacturer of optical lenses (including those for the first Canon cameras) and equipment used in cameras, binoculars, microscopes and inspection equipment. During World War II, the company operated thirty factories with 2,000 employess, manufacturing binoculars, lenses, bomb sights and pericscopes for the Japanese military.</p>
		<h3>Digital Photography</h3>
		<p>Nikon created some of the first digital SLRs(DSLRs, Nikon NASA F4) for NASA, used in the Space Shuttle since 1991. After a 1990s partenership with Kodak to produce digital SLR cameras based on existing Nikon film bodies, Nikon released the Nikon D1 SLR under its own name in 1999. Although it used an APS-C size light size light sensor only 2/3 the size of a 35mm film frame (later called a "DX sensor"), the D1 was among the first digital cameras to have sufficient image quality and a low enough price for some professionals (particularly photojournalists and sports photographers) to use it as a replacement for a film SLR. The company also has a Coolpix line which grew as consumer digital photography became increasingly prevalent through the early 2000s. Through the mid-2000s, Nikon's line of professional and enthusiast DSLRs and lenses including their back compatible AF-S lens line remained in second place behind Canon in SLR camera sales, and Cannon had several years' lead in producing professional DSLRs with light sensors as large as traditional 35mm film frames. All Nikon DSLRs from 1999 to 2007, by contrast, used the smaller DX size sensor. Then, 2005 management changes at Nikon led to new camera designs such as the full-frame Nikon D3 in late 2007, the Nikon D700 a few months later, and mid-range SLRs. Nikon regained much of its reputation among professional and amateur enthusiast photographers as a leading innovator in the field, especially because of speed, ergonomics, and low-light performance of its lastest models. The mid-range Nikon D90, introduced in 2008, was also the first SLR camera to record video. Since then video mode has been introduced to many more of the Nikon DSLR cameras including Nikon D3S, Nikon D7000, Nikon D5100, Nikon D3100, NIkon D3200 and Nikon D5100. More recently, NIkon has released a photograph and video editing suite called ViewNX to browse, edit, merge and share images and videos.</p>
